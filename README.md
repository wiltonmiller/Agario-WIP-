# Agario-WIP-
Simple game in Java aimed to emulate the popular  game Agario.

Java Agario Clone (WIP)
Introduction
Dive into the development of a minimalist rendition of the popular online game Agar.io, reimagined in Java. This project is an ongoing effort to recreate the core mechanics of the addictive multiplayer action where players control a cell in a petri dish, with the objective of growing larger by consuming smaller cells and pellets while avoiding being consumed by larger cells.

Project Status: Under Construction ðŸš§

This Java Agario Clone is currently in a paused stage of development. It is a sandbox for testing and implementing game mechanics in Java with a focus on object-oriented design.

Basic Movement Mechanics: Allowing player-controlled cells to navigate the game space.

Eating Mechanism: Functionality for cells to consume pellets and smaller cells.

Player Growth Algorithm: Logic for dynamically increasing the size of the player's cell.

Multiplayer Networking: (Planned) Backend for supporting multiple players in a single game session.

UI Elements: (Planned) Developing a user interface to display scores and handle user inp
